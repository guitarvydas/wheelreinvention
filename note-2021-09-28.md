short answer: PLs are obviated by Ohm-JS(PEG)-based notations and OSs are merely glorified libraries (which can be obviated by using better library technology (e.g. LEGO(R-like blocks)). 

From my perspective, the wheels that need the most reinventing are our habits based on old biases, e.g. languages and operating systems.  The old biases - CPUs are expensive, memory is scarce and expensive - are no longer true. 

[There are many other biases, such as the idea that GPLs (General Purpose Programming Languages) must be based on grids of non-overlapping bitmaps (aka Characters, Text).]

long answer: I couldn't bring myself to pasting the reply here, so I put it here [We Don't Need Programming Languages Nor Operating Systems](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/09/29/Programming-Languages-and-OSs-Not-Needed.html)
