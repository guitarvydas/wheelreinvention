title:  "We Don't Need Programming Languages Nor Operating Systems"
---

# Programming Languages:
There are only 2 important things for programming computers:

1.  Getting computers to do what we want (augment human capabilities with machinery).

2. Paradigms.

Programming Languages fall in between 1 & 2.

One can do away with programming languages and replace them with simpler "notatoins" using Ohm-JS (PEG).  

I think of notations as very simple DSLs.  

It should take only 10's of minutes to produce a notation. 

Notations can be tuned to a particular problem (like Physicists do). 

Multiple Notations can be used on a single problem. 

Notations can be transpiled into other languages (I call them Toolbox Languages), like Python, JavaScript, Common Lisp, etc. 

Notations are like "new" compilers - instead of compiling to assembler, they compile to Toolbox Languages.

# Operating Systems
Operating systems are just libraries.  

One feature that OSs provide is multitasking. 

The kind of multitasking they provide is rife with accidental complexity - "we're going to make this square peg fit our notation even if it kills us".  

For example, current OSs provide features to deal with thread safety. 

Thread safety is accidental complexity caused by the use of memory sharing. Memory Sharing is used only due to old-fashioned premature optimization (CPUs and Memory used to be expensive in the 1950's). 

If we build computing devices using many rPIs, each running exactly one program (no Linux), then thread safety becomes a non-issue. Poof.

Another feature that OSs provide is honest-to-goodness big lumps of library code, like file handling. 

That stuff simply can be moved into LEGO(R) components that replace the concept of libraries. 

No OS needed for this, either. 

Poof.

# LEGO(R) Block Software

The keys to making LEGO(R) block software are:

- isolation
- concurrency.
