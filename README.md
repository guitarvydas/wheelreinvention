# Wheel Reinvention

The wheels that need the most reinventing are our habits based on old biases, e.g. languages and operating systems.  The old biases - CPUs are expensive, memory is scarce and expensive - are no longer true. 

# What Matters?

There is only one thing that matters:
	1.	controlling machines[^1]

We resort to things that we call:
- paradigms
- experience.

Programming languages are merely syntactic sugar for the above.

Can we create a toolbox of paradigms, then drape syntactic sugar over the paradigms?

Yes.

[^1]: Machines that we call "computers".

# Programming Languages

The concept of programming languages, especially GPLs (General Purpose Languages), should be deprecated.

GPLs are obviated by Ohm-JS(PEG)-based notations.

# Operating Systems

OSs are merely glorified libraries (which can be obviated by using better library technology (e.g. LEGO(R-like blocks)). 

# Other Biases

There are many other biases, such as 

- the idea that GPLs (General Purpose Programming Languages) must be based on grids of non-overlapping bitmaps (aka Characters, Text).
- 2D notation.
    Until now, we had only paper (pencil-and-paper) to use when evolving ideas.
    Now, we have 3D workstations that can be used.
