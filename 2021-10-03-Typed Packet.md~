# Overview

A very, very simple example of a typed packet.

# Input
input: 4 bytes
# Output
output: int64

# Initial Verification:
if there are 4 bytes remaining in the stream
then
  grab the next 4 bytes
else
  declare error
end if
wrap header and trailer onto the 4 bytes

tag = flexible number of bytes, last byte has high bit set
for example int8 =  00000001
for example int16 = 00000011
for example int32 = 00000101
for example int64 = 00000111
see early dynamically typed languages for ideas on how best to arrange tags (see, also, Huffman encoding)

so, in this example, we produce 6 bytes (header, 4 bytes, trailer)

0x07, ??, ??, ??, ??, 0x07

output of this stage = 6 bytes

[Note the similarities between this scheme and network packets].
